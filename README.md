HumanX is an attempt to make AI more like AGI. 
# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE INSTALLING!

>16GB of RAM to run AGI features (if you have less than 16GB of RAM, AGI features are disabled by default.)
>20-40GB of disk space 
> RTX 70 series or AMD equivilant. MPS (Apple Silicon) is supported, but at the moment, but performance might be poor. Please note that system packages vary differently between OSs.

HumanX is built on GPT-Neo-1.3B to try to make it usable on normal computers, but if you have a more powerful computer; you can update your model preferences if running locally.
As this is in beta, bias towards certain things will be extremely high, as HumanX incorporates a belief system. 
Please note that HumanX is open source, and available to everyone.

This is only an attempt at AGI. Full AGI features will be too hard and extremely resource-intensive of the likes we don't have, so take "AGI" with a grain of salt when viewing and editing this code. 
Benchmark data will be arriving later, but not at the moment.

I cocenetated all features into one code for simplicity.
