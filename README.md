HumanX is an attempt to make AI more like AGI. 
# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE INSTALLING!

>16GB of RAM to run AGI features (if you have less than 16GB of RAM, AGI features are disabled by default.)
>20-40GB of disk space 
> RTX 70 series or equivilant. MPS (Apple Silicon) may work fine, but your mileage will vary.

HumanX is built on GPT-Neo-2.7B to try to make it usable on normal computers, but if you have a more powerful computer; you can update your model preferences if running locally.
As this is in beta, bias towards certain things will be extremely high, as HumanX incorporates a belief system. 
Please note that HumanX is open source, and available to everyone.

This is only an attempt at AGI. Full AGI features will be too hard and extremely resource-intensive of the likes we don't have, so take "AGI" with a grain of salt when viewing and editing this code.
